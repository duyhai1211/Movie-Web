# Movie Web (Trailer)

This project is a movie web application built using **React**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS**. The application retrieves movie data from **The Movie Database (TMDb)** API and includes features like dynamic carousels, YouTube video embedding, and customizable modal pop-ups.

## Features

- **TMDb API**: Fetch movie data like movie details, trailers, and images.
- **Dynamic Carousels**: Use `react-multi-carousel` for creating interactive carousels to display movie data.
- **YouTube Integration**: Embed and control YouTube trailers with `react-youtube`.
- **Modals**: Display detailed movie information in a modal using `react-modal`.

## Installation

To get started with the project, clone the repository and install the dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install react-multi-carousel react-youtube react-modal

Setup

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working with Vite and includes HMR (Hot Module Replacement) for a fast development experience. The project uses Tailwind CSS for styling and includes ESLint rules for code quality.

To use React with Vite, two official plugins are available:
	•	@vitejs/plugin-react: Uses Babel for Fast Refresh.
	•	@vitejs/plugin-react-swc: Uses SWC for Fast Refresh.
